\section{Multiplier}

\subsection{Definition of Government Spending Multiplier}

A key figure to decide whether a fiscal intervention by the government is desirable or not is the multiplier. We need to know (or at least estimate) what are the effects of a spending hike in the economy and the multiplier is an important figure to help answer this question. The multiplier measures the impact that marginal variations of government spending has on the economy. It is defined as the increase in GDP generated by a marginal increase in government spending. If government steps in and spends one extra euro, it is not clear a priori how the agents will react to that. It can be argued that the one who receives this euro might save a fraction of it and spend the rest and so generates a virtuous circle that will boost the economy. On the other hand, it also pressures government budget, which might trigger uncertainty about government's ability of paying back its debt. This in turn will likely lead to the agents cutting back on spending and saving for possibly hard times in the future. In general lines, it is not clear what are the implications of government intervention in a crisis scenario. In this sense, understanding the multiplier becomes very important, since it is this one number that states whether the government is good or not. The multiplier $m_t$ can be expressed formally as

\begin{equation}
  m_t = \frac{dY_t}{dG_t} = \frac{1}{g_y}\frac{dy_t}{dg_t}
\end{equation}

\bigskip
where $g_y$ is the government share of GDP in the steady state.

\subsection{The Multiplier in the Model}

In the model, the multiplier too has a stairway format. The multiplier is constant as long as the duration of the liquidity trap remains unchanged. This means that each extra euro spent by the government will have the same effect on output if the liquidity trap duration is not affected. Once the increase in government spending is big enough to shorten the duration of the liquidity trap by one period, the multiplier declines. Government spending becomes then less effective in boosting the economy. In Figure \ref{fig:averagemultiplier}, which depicts a model with no inflation, the multiplier is  0.584 in case government does not to the decline in output. The multiplier remains constant at 0.584 until the increase in spending surpasses the threshold of 1.46\% of GDP. At this point, the liquidity trap becomes one period shorter, which makes the multiplier decrease to 0.548. This mechanism works in this fashion (big enough government spending hike leads to shorter liquidity trap and smaller multiplier) until the size of the increase in government spending is so big that the economy gets out of the liquidity trap. After that, the multiplier is constant in the model irrespective of the size of the government in the economy.

The case we have been considering, in which prices do not vary at all, displays a relatively low multiplier. In fact, it is smaller than unity. Once we allow for the more realistic scenario with sticky but not completely fixed prices, the multiplier increases by a considerable amount. Figure \ref{fig:mulalt} shows the multiplier schedule for three different average price durations. The more flexible the prices, the higher the multiplier for a given level of government spending. With four-quarter contracts (Calvo parameter set to 0.75), the multiplier reaches a far greater value of 3.828 meaning that each euro spent by the government will increase GDP by 3.828 euros (as long, of course, as spending hike is not too big to shorten the liquidity trap). A large multiplier makes a strong case for government intervention to boost the economy. Figure \ref{fig:mulalt} tells, however, also another story and a word of caution is necessary. Although we have a higher multiplier the more flexible the prices are, the drop in the multiplier caused by the shortening of the liquidity trap is also stronger in this case, i.e. the multiplier falls sharply with the level of government spending when prices are not very sticky. This observation leads to the central distinction between average and marginal multiplier, which is central for the paper we are analyzing.

\subsection{Marginal vs. Average Multiplier}

The multiplier itself is a marginal concept. It tells by how much GDP grows if government increases spending by one percent. More important for policy making, however, is what \citet{Erceg.2014} have called the \textit{average multiplier}. Governments, while intervening in an economy, never do so by increasing spending only by a little amount. Rather, in face of an economic slow down, they often introduce stimulus packages of many millions of euros. In such a scenario, the marginal interpretation offered by the multiplier may not be very useful, especially if the multiplier varies significantly with the level of government spending. In face of a given-sized spending hike, the average multiplier tells us how much \textit{on average} each extra euro spent by the government contributed to the increase in GDP. For the policy maker, it is of greater interest to know the average impact of higher spending (average multiplier) than the impact of first euro spent (marginal multiplier) if the hike is high and the multiplier varies a lot with the size of government spending. This is exactly the case with the model of \citet{Erceg.2014}. In rough lines, the marginal multiplier is certainly very high in a liquidity trap. But it decreases fast once the government intervenes and, through increases in government spending, shortens the liquidity trap.


% The average multiplier does not zoom in on a specific point - say 3\% increase â€“ and answers the question by how much would GDP increase if spending increases by a marginal amount. Given the nature of the model and the decreasing multiplier, it is well known that the first euro spent will boost the economy by a greater amount than the last one. The concept of average multiplier abstracts from these differences and tells us what on average was the effect of each euro of extra spending on output. In this sense, the average multiplier is between the marginal multiplier when the government stays inert and the marginal multiplier when government has already stepped in and spent money to boost the economy.


Thus, an important message from the model is the following: although it may seem attractive to increase government spending in a liquidity trap because of the higher marginal multiplier, the overall effect on the economy might not be as pronounced as one is led to believe by analyzing the marginal multiplier only. This is so because the marginal multiplier decreases rapidly as the duration of the liquidity trap becomes shorter. It turns out that the average multiplier, i.e. the average contribution of each extra euro spent to GDP, is not as large as the marginal multiplier, i.e. the increase that would have occurred had the government pushed spending only by a little amount.

\subsection{How to calculate the multiplier}

It turns that the multiplier cannot be calculated analytically in the model. For that reason, we used a numerical approach to calculate the multiplier and get the a multiplier schedule that resembles a stairway. For that, we used a Dynare loop to simulate the model with 551 different government shocks. We started with the scenario in which government \textit{cuts} spending by 50\% of GDP and went through increasing the government shock by 0.2\% until we reached the situation in which government \textit{increases} spending also by 50\% of GDP.

We then calculated the marginal multiplier as following. For each $ i \in {2,\cdots, 551} $, we calculated:

\begin{equation}
  m_i = \frac{1}{g_y} \frac{y_i - y_{i-1}}{g_i - g_{i-1}}
\end{equation}

This ensured that the marginal interpretation of the multiplier is still valid, since the difference between $ g_i $ and $ g_{i-1}$ is very small. Also because of this small difference, we succeeded in plotting the stairway multiplier schedule without the line linking two multipliers in different liquidity traps being flat to be noticed.

\section{Fiscal Free Lunch}

Given that the multiplier is so high, would it be the case of a fiscal free lunch? \citet{Erceg.2014} have also addressed this question. A fiscal free lunch would occur if the extra economic activity generated by the fiscal stimulus is so great that the taxes collected over it would be greater than the stimulus itself. Contrary to common-sense, an increase in spending would in fact reduce overall public debt, i.e. the deficit would decrease.

This issue is best answered by analyzing Figure~\ref{fig:debt}. It depicts the marginal effect that government spending has on government debt. The striking conclusion of the model is that for four-quarter contracts, a spending hike of one percent of GDP causes the debt to fall by roughly 0.7 percentage points. In this very scenario, even increases in spending in amounts greater than 7\% of GDP would be self-financing.
