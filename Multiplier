\section{Multiplier}

\subsection{Definition of Government Spending Multiplier}

The multiplier is to be understood as the increase in GDP generated by a marginal increase in government spending. If government steps in and spends one extra euro, a fraction of this one euro will be spent and further economic activity will be generated.

\subsection{Marginal vs. Average Multiplier}

The multiplier itself is a marginal concept. It always tells how much will GDP grow if government is increased by one percent. More important for policy making, however, is what Lindé Erceg have called the average multiplier for lack of a better term for it. Governments, while intervening in an economy, never do so by increasing spending only by a little amount. Rather, in face of an economic slow down, they often introduce packages of many millions of euros. In such a scenario, the marginal interpretation offered by the multiplier may not be very useful, especially if the multiplier varies significantly with the level of government spending.

This is exactly the case with the model of Lindé  Erceg. In rough lines, the marginal multiplier is certainly very high in a liquidity trap. But it decreases fast once the government intervenes and, through increases in government spending, shortens the liquidity trap.

Thus, an important lesson one might learn from the model is that although it must appear attractive to increase government spending in a liquidity trap because of the higher marginal multiplier, the overall effect on the economy might not be as pronounced as one is led to believe by analyzing the average multiplier only. This is so because the marginal multiplier decreases rapidly as the duration of the liquidity trap becomes shorter. It turns out that the average multiplier, i.e. the average contribution of each extra euro spent to GDP, is not nearly as large as the marginal multiplier, the increase that would have occurred had the government pushed spending only by a little amount.

In a liquidity trap, the central bank has very limited means to affect the economy. Against this backdrop, fiscal policy becomes very important since it is the only tool governments have to stimulate an economy.

In loglinearized version of the model, the multiplier turns out to be constant in the absence of the liquidity trap.
