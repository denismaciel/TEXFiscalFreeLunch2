\section{Multiplier}

\subsection{Definition of Government Spending Multiplier}

The multiplier is to be understood as the increase in GDP generated by a marginal increase in government spending. If government steps in and spends one extra euro, a fraction of this one euro will be spent and further economic activity will be generated. The multiplier $m_t$ can be expressed formally as

\begin{equation}
  m_t = \frac{dY_t}{dG_t} = \frac{1}{g_y}\frac{dy_t}{dg_t}
\end{equation}

where $g_y$ is the government share of GDP in the steady state.

\subsection{The Multiplier in the Model}

In the model, the multiplier too has a stairway format. The multiplier is constant as long as the duration of the liquidity trap remains unchanged. This means that each extra euro spent by the government will have the same effect on output if the liquidity trap duration is not affected. Once the increase in government spending is big enough to shorten the duration of the liquidity trap by one period, the multiplier declines. Government spending becomes then less effective in boosting the economy. In Figure \ref{fig:averagemultiplier}, which depicts a model with no inflation, the multiplier is  0.584 in the case that government does not increase spending. The multiplier remains constant at 0.584 until the increase in spending surpasses the threshold of 1.46\%. At this point, the liquidity trap becomes one period shorter, which makes the multiplier decrease to 0.548. This mechanism works in this fashion (big enough government spending hike leads to shorter liquidity trap and smaller multiplier) until the size of the increase in government spending is so big that the economy gets out of the liquidity trap. After that, the multiplier is constant in the model irrespective of the size of the government in the economy.

Until now we have considered the case where prices do not vary at all. Once we allow for the more realistic scenario with sticky but not completely fixed prices, the multiplier increases by a considerable amount. Figure \ref{fig:mulalt} shows the multiplier schedule for three different average price durations. The more flexible the prices, the higher the multiplier for a given level of government spending. With four-quarter contracts (Calvo parameter set to 0.75), the increases up to 5 meaning that each euro spent by the government will increase GDP by 5 euros. This makes a strong case for government intervention to boost the economy. Figure \ref{fig:mulalt} delivers also the message that although the multiplier is highest with completely flexible prices, the drop in the multiplier caused by the shortening of the liquidity trap is also stronger, i.e. the multiplier falls sharply with the level of government spending.

This observation leads to the central distinction between average and marginal multiplier, which is central for the paper we are analyzing.

\subsection{Marginal vs. Average Multiplier}

The multiplier itself is a marginal concept. It tells how much GDP grows if government increases spending by one percent. More important for policy making, however, is what Lindé Erceg have called the "average multiplier" for lack of a better term. Governments, while intervening in an economy, never do so by increasing spending only by a little amount. Rather, in face of an economic slow down, they often introduce stimulus packages of many millions of euros. In such a scenario, the marginal interpretation offered by the multiplier may not be very useful, especially if the multiplier varies significantly with the level of government spending.

This is exactly the case with the model of Lindé  Erceg. In rough lines, the marginal multiplier is certainly very high in a liquidity trap. But it decreases fast once the government intervenes and, through increases in government spending, shortens the liquidity trap.

Thus, an important message from the model is the following: although it must appear attractive to increase government spending in a liquidity trap because of the higher marginal multiplier, the overall effect on the economy might not be as pronounced as one is led to believe by analyzing the average multiplier only. This is so because the marginal multiplier decreases rapidly as the duration of the liquidity trap becomes shorter. It turns out that the average multiplier, i.e. the average contribution of each extra euro spent to GDP, is not nearly as large as the marginal multiplier, the increase that would have occurred had the government pushed spending only by a little amount.

\section{Fiscal Free Lunch}

Given that the multiplier is so high, would it be the case of a fiscal free lunch? This question Erceg and Linde have also addressed. A fiscal free lunch would occur if the extra economic activity generated by the fiscal stimulus is so great that the taxes collected over it would be greater than the stimulus itself. Contrary to common-sense, an increase in spending would in fact reduce overall public debt, i.e. the deficit would decrease.

This issue is best answered by analyzing Figure~\ref{fig:debt}. It depicts the marginal effect that government spending has on government debt. The striking conclusion of the model is that for four-quarter contracts, a spending hike of one percent of GDP causes the debt to fall by roughly 0.7 percentage points. In this very scenario, even increases in spending in amounts greater than 7\% of GDP would be self-financing.
